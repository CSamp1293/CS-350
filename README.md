# CS-350 7-1 Project (Smart Thermostat)

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The final project (7-1) was essentially creating a working smart thermostat that reads temperature using the sensor on the provided TI board and adjusts to a set temperature (by the user) dynamically. Additionally, there are buttons for the user to raise or lower the set temperature, which would then be matched by the ambient temperature by utilizing the aforementioned sensor to adjust the temperature. 

## What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did particularly well in ensuring the code maintained readability in the main thread. This is an often overlooked yet important aspect of creating a program, as that is where the "magic" happens. Ensuring readability in the main thread is a critical aspect of maintaining best coding practices. 

## Where could you improve?
I could improve everywhere. As an inspiring developer, if you cannot think how to improve something, then you are missing something. Developers should always look for ways to improve their code whether it be making it more readable, or following more closely to best practices. 

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am adding more experience working with CCS, as well as experience in programming the MCU. Before taking this course, I had never programmed an MCU, nor have I used CCS often. This led to learning a lot from this course and I look forward to how I can utilize what I learned in future projects. 

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills from this project that I find will be particularly transferable to future courses and projects is the code structure and my understanding of embedded systems. These skills will be very useful moving forward as I get deeper into my program which surrounds software engineering. 

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I always try to keep my code neat, organized, and devoid of any uneccessary or obsolete lines of code to help maintain readability. The code used for this project could be adjusted easily to alter the output, which allows for maintainability as well. 

# CS-350 3-2 Milestone (UART LED Control)
* I was unable to upload the video file for this milestone as it is too big *

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Milestone 3-2, which is the use creating characters to read from the UART, was simply creating a program to control the red LEDs. The objective was to have the LED turn on, when a user types "ON" into the terminal and to turn off when the user types "OFF" into the terminal. 

## What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did well maintaining readability through the code. This a crucial aspect for maintainability and the abilty to update the output and input. 

## Where could you improve?
I could improve further on my readability of the code. I have some unsused lines of code in my work that could be removed and further improve the ability to maintain and read the program. 

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
As with the final project (7-1) I added experience working with CCS and the MCU. Additionally, with this milestone, I added to my understanding of the UART and how to utilize it to help control certain functionality.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Similar to the final project (7-1), the skills I find most useful are imporving my code structure and my understanding of embedded systems. 

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
As I did with the final project, I tried to keep my code as neat and organized as possible to maintain readability and the ability to maintain the program. Admittedly, as this milestone was done prior to the final project, it is not as nice and clean as my code for the final project is. However, it does still follow best practices, I just would go back and clean it up some more (like removing unused functions and/or variables).
